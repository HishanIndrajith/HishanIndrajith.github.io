                                        Hello, I just thought to write about my first working experience in industry. I
                                        had the
                                        opportunity to work at CodeGen International (pvt) Ltd for my 6 month internship
                                        period.
                                        Of course that was a great time and a nice experience there to understand how
                                        industry
                                        working and get exposure.
                                        I worked in Research and Development team and involved in few projects in web
                                        crawling
                                        and used technologies java, spring boot, mysql etc. Through the internship I got
                                        knowledge and experience on latest trends of software engineering and got a nice
                                        working
                                        experience with a great set of people.
                                    </p>

                                    <b> How I got Selected</b>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        It was basically through interview and a small technical test. The CVs of
                                        interested
                                        students have been sent to the company through department. Then they shortlisted
                                        a set
                                        of candidates and asked to come to their office for an test. I was also among
                                        them and
                                        We had a small written test which contained java questions as well as MYSQL
                                        design
                                        problems. So after that we were interviewed separately.
                                        After few days, I was informed about my internship opportunity.
                                    </p>

                                    <b> Induction Session</b>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        After starting the internship period, I had to follow the induction training
                                        session. We
                                        were given presentations on introduction to company, introduction to
                                        technologies in
                                        company and session by HR department in this period.
                                        Also we were given and training assignment to finish with a deadline. The
                                        assignment was
                                        a development of a simple Hotel Booking System using Angular, Spring Boot, REST
                                        API, and
                                        MySQL.
                                        Also in this induction period what I felt most important was the technical
                                        training
                                        sessions for the interns. They were basically focused on the technologies
                                        important for
                                        the training assignment as well as whole internship program. The technologies
                                        like
                                        Angular, Spring Boot, Docker, Linux, UI/UX were covered through these sessions.
                                        It was a
                                        great help for the internship.
                                        As the company followed Agile development practise, we had scrum meetings each
                                        day, I
                                        got the first experience of a scrum meeting through that.
                                        Also the training assignment was a great help to identify how to work in
                                        industrial
                                        environment and to get ready with that mindset for the rest of internship
                                        program.
                                        After the end of induction period, there was a review and we were assigned to
                                        actual
                                        projects within R&D.
                                    </p>

                                    <b> Projects Did</b>
                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        After the induction period, I was assigned to a team that does web crawling. I
                                        was
                                        assigned to design and implement few new web crawlers. A web crawler is a
                                        program or
                                        automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated
                                        manner and
                                        extract the required data from them. I used java as the language and Jsoup
                                        library for
                                        the development.
                                        I myself successfully implemented 4 web crawlers to be used in the team. They
                                        basically
                                        crawl, event data all over the world, school holidays, hotel booking package
                                        data,
                                        reviews of Hotels, Attractions and Restaurants.
                                        Also there was a project for me to extract few defined features like Board
                                        basis, Room
                                        Type, View from a large set of booking descriptions crawled so far. It was a
                                        part of
                                        data preprocessing. There was an internal API to extract keywords from such
                                        statements.
                                        I wrote a program to work as client for that API and extract features and save
                                        in files.
                                        At the end of the projects, there was a code review as well as a final feedback
                                        session.
                                        I got a very good feedback at the end.

                                    <p class="mb-30">
                                        All the trainees including me had few interactive sessions from Toastmasters

                                        CodeGen. They were ice breaker speech that I had to talk about me in front of an
                                        audience.
                                        A table topic session where I had to talk on an given topic at that time, A
                                        presentation
                                        where I have to do an presentation on something.

                                        Those sessions were good and very interesting. Also these helped me a lot to

                                        speech ability, and learn the correct techniques of speech and presenting
