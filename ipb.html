                                        In military operations armed forces have to get a better idea of the area in
                                        which they have to operate including terrain features, threats and avenues of
                                        approach.
                                        So they gather intelligence on the location, enemy, weather, vegetation,
                                        infrastructure and many such factors before making decisions. Intelligence
                                        Preparation of the Battleﬁeld (IPB) is the name given for that process of
                                        analyzing the situation and making decisions based on predictions. Usually this
                                        process happen manually by ofﬁcers using hard copy maps and it have number of
                                        inconveniences. In this paper, we implement and present a set of algorithms,
                                        tools and approaches for automating terrain analysis and decision making in
                                        Intelligence Preparation of the Battleﬁeld process and compare their results
                                        with a manual analysis.

                                        IPB is a process that starts in advance of operations and continues during
                                        operations planning and execution. It provides guidelines for the gathering,
                                        analysis, and organization of intelligence. The purpose of this intelligence is
                                        to inform a commander’s decision process during the preparation for, and
                                        execution of a mission. Therefore IPB is a Command and staff tool which allows
                                        systematic and continuous analysis of the enemy and the battleﬁeld environment.
                                        It presents the results of the process in a graphical format. It is an
                                        integrated method of analysing Enemy, Ground and Friendly Forces factors in the
                                        Estimate.

                                        The problem with current process is that IPB is done manually by intelligence
                                        ofﬁcers using hard copy maps on which they anotate various signiﬁcant areas,
                                        such as key terrain or defensible terrain. This manual process suffers from a
                                        number of inefﬁciencies as described below.

                                    <h4>Web-based platform to display overlays on a map</h4>

                                    <p>
                                        As the IPB need a visual tool that allows military staff to add battlefield data
                                        in to the system and also visualize them as overlays, we needed to firstly
                                        develop a web based platform to add overlays and visualize them. So we firstly
                                        researched about a framework that we can use to do the map based functions.
                                        Simply from front-end side the application should work like a GIS software.
                                        Following technologies were chosen by us to be used fro the web platform.

                                        <p>
                                            We needed to find a data storing mechanism and also a data format to store
                                            the overlay data. As the data in overlay are spatial data with attributes,
                                            We researched about the available methods to store such data.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            So the available options to store those data were using a <code>vector
                                            format</code> or a <code>raster format</code>.
                                            So as our web application was JS based, we choose <a
                                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON" class="urlextern"

                                            which is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            To store and provide the required overlay information relevant to
                                            battlefields, there should be a back-end application. As our future
                                            algorithms and models are based on python, we used <a

                                            Flask</a> as the web framework for our back-end and the we decided to use
                                            REST architecture to build the back-end web service.

                                            Finally we had to integrate the back-end we developed using the data storing

                                            Architecture. Presentation layer being our web tool using LeafletJS,
                                            Application layer being the python web application using Flask and use REST
                                            web services to communicate with Presentation layer.
                                            Data layer is the filesystem which stores GeoJSON files in a hierarchical
                                            structure.

                                        <h4>A grid based combined obstacle overlay by collecting the vector overlays to
                                            a grid</h4>

                                        <p>
                                            As we have built the overlays using a vector format with properties, we
                                            needed to convert those data overlays to grids of their properties as grid
                                            based analysis is used for the processing. We started from the elevation
                                            raster file of Sri Lanka obtained from SRTM dataset. In our program to get
                                            the combined obstacle overlay first step was to get the elevation grid. So
                                            our program was added the functionality to clip the Sri Lanka elevation
                                            raster file to the size of the battlefield firstly.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            The NASA’s Space Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM data's
                                            resolution is about 30 meters. It has pixels (cells) of grid approximately
                                            30m containing elevation data. See the image below.
                                        </p>

                                        <p align="center">

                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            We needed to map these elevation data to a grid of cells of size 10 times
                                            smaller than SRTM data resolution for better accuracy as 30m is not a good
                                            resolution for ﬁnding mobility. So elevation data graph was resampled using
                                            bi-linear interpolation in order to reduce the resolution of the overlay
                                            grid size to about 3 meters. The elevation data raster overlay after
                                            resampling is shown in below.
                                        </p>


                                        <p>
                                            So the other overlay grids was also to be built to the same shape of the
                                            elevation grid obtained, such that they can be put one on other.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            So next from the elevation grid, an additional grid of slope was derived.
                                            The slope grid is produced such that slope at grid cell (x,y) is assigned
                                            the mean of the slope between (x,y) and each of the surrounding grid cells.
                                            Following Figure shows the generated slope overlay for above elevation
                                            example.

                                            Rasterization techniques were used to get the rater images of the building,
                                            water, road and vegetation overlays preserving their properties and those
                                            raster images of the overlays were converted to a numpy array for our
                                            processing. Following images will show the original map, building grid,

                                            Our target in this milestone was to obtain combined obstacle overlay by
                                            combining all these overlays in a suitable way to achieve our goal. So we
                                            constructed an overlay called trafficability grid combinning all those
                                            overlays (elevation, slope, building, vegetation, water, roads)
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            Trafficability grid is a grid witch has cells representing squares on land,
                                            where each grid cell represent the trafficability of the cell. In another
                                            way each cell give a value defining how much it is difficult to troop
                                            maneuver withing that cell.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            We considered the electric flow model as a foundation of our algorithm to
                                            get trafficability grid. In electric current point of view, the electric
                                            current or the flow of electrons is determined by the resistance of the
                                            medium. The resistance is determined by the resistivity of the materials
                                            used in the medium.
                                            If the resistance per unit length is <em>k</em>, the resistance of
                                            <em>l</em> length medium becomes <em>k x l</em>.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            So for each property that we consider that would effect trafficability from
                                            the overlays, we defined a value denoting resistance per distance for troop
                                            maneuver. So the total resistance per distance for a given grid cell is the
                                            sum of all resistances per length of properties that belong to that cell.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            So our algorithm used in obtaining the trafficability using the resistance
                                            model is given below.
