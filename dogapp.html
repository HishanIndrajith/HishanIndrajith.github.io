                    Problem: We don’t have a good estimate of the dog population in Sri Lanka. Having accurate count of dog in Streets is mandatory for population control strategies. Furthermore stray dogs in Sri Lanka comprise of dogs owned dogs, community dogs and without owners. Estimating these groups are also required for dog population control work. Concept: Is to Develop an Application to be used for dog counting where both dogs living in house and in streets can be reported. Task: To develop an application that can be used in mobile devices that have features to report and record information of dogs and their closes location with GPS coordinate information.

                    <h3>Project Decription</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">
                   We developed the mobile application for only android platform. We used android studio to 
                    develop and java and xml was the languages we used. As according to statistics, majority of 
                    mobile phone users of Sri Lanka use android phones other than other platfor
                    ms. So the 
                    platform we choose was android. Also easiness in developing in android was also a reason.    
                    The flow of the operation when a user add a dog was made and the software was developed 
                    accordingly.</p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>User starts the app.</li>
                      <li>Click to get location - GPS location is received.</li>
                      <li>Click to take a photo using camera or gallery.</li>
                      <li>Choose colors of the dog from list</li>
                      <li>Choose whether the dog is stray or not.</li>
                      <li>Choose whether the dog is a puppy or not.</li>
                      <li>Click to submit - photo uploading finishes</li>
                      <li>User get suggestions of close dogs around the location submitted with their images and three options to choose saying that the dog is same dog, may be and not same. (The suggestions are the dogs in database with location inside 1km x 1km square with current location at center)</li>
                      <li>User responds to suggestions.</li>
                      <li>Dog adding process finishes and a thanking screen is shown.</li>
                    </ol></br>
                    <h3>Implementation</h3>
                    <p class="mb-30">
                    Location is needed with a good accuracy for a dog to be inserted. So we had to use only GPS 
                    provider to get location. But it take few much time for first GPS location fix to arrive.
                    Network provider provide location based on towers quickly than GPS, but
                    not accurate. As 
                    we need accuracy much we used GPS for the location provider. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">But when the GPS listener is on, there is a high battery drain. To avoid that we start the 
                    listener, listen for a fixed number of location fixes, get the most accurate out of t
                    hose and 
                    close the listener.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">GPS locations are followed by an accuracy in meters. It is radial type one. That says that a 
                    circle around the location with radius equal to accuracy in meters will have the real position 
                    inside the circle and the probability o
                    f having it there is 68%.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Also it was implemented to sign up to the service using the app for any user. He must 
                  provide user name, email and enter a password submit. Then the server will send an email 
                  to the 
                  user with a
                  verification code, The app will ask 
                  for it and once you provide it you are 
                  registered and suitable to contribute. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">User can log in
                    once and the user details are 
                    kept in shared preferences and unless he 
                    logout he needs not log in again when opening the app. That means logged
                    -
                    in feature is 
                    ava
                    ilable in the app. </p>
                    <p class="mb-30">User can add a photo using either camera or gallery. User must choose color of dog out of 
                    colors white, brown, black and gray.
                    Also few other details. (Stray/not, puppy/not)</p>

                  <p class="mb-30">Another important feature is suggestions. It reduces the risk 
                  of having duplicate dogs added 
                  to system. (only reduce, not prevent)</p>
                  <p class="mb-30">The mobile app has been made to be a user friendly one. Nice colors and shapes. </p>
                  <p class="mb-30">Front end web app is to be used by administrators to view results. It shows dog counts in 
                  different
                  ,111.11
                  categories and also total dogs can be viewed in a map.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-30">The 
                  assumption related to GPS coordinates and distances is 111,111.11 m is equal to 1 
                  degree latitude, and 111,111.111 cos (latitude) is equal to 1 degree longitude. This was 
                  needed when getting suggestions because the suggestions are chosen from a square of 1
                  km 
                  side, around the location of added dog. Also it check whether the color code matches and 
                  details of dog matches. </p>
